# Session Continuity Handoff - 2026 Bitcoin/Fintech Events Analysis

**Date Created:** January 16, 2026
**Status:** Analysis complete, ready for continuation and expansion
**Next Session Focus:** Competitor landscape analysis + event-specific strategies

---

## 1. Purpose & Context

**What This Is:**
Go-to-market analysis of 2026 Bitcoin/fintech events to inform budget allocation and channel strategy for Bitwage, TeamPay, and Mining business units.

**Business Problem:**
- Limited budget ($25k per-event cap, constrained overall)
- Multiple business units with different GTM motions
- Need to prioritize events that deliver ROI (direct revenue OR ecosystem positioning)
- LATAM geographic focus for cost efficiency

**Stakeholder Goal:**
Internal signal sharing with non-junior, data-driven recommendations for event attendance decisions across Q1-Q4 2026.

**Key Deliverables Created:**
1. Event analysis with PRIMARY/SECONDARY business unit tags
2. Budget allocation tiers ($80k immediate commitments, up to $101k with monitoring events)
3. Stakeholder email with recommendations (TO: TBD, CC: Ramiro/Jonathan, BCC: Jeremy/Mark)

---

## 2. Business Unit Positioning

### Bitwage

**Product:** Cross-border payroll and contractor payments using Bitcoin/stablecoin rails

**Target Customers:**
- CFOs, finance/payroll operators
- Companies with cross-border employees/contractors (especially LATAM ↔ US/EU)
- Remote-first companies with FX friction pain

**Sales Cycle:** Short-medium, pain-driven (buyer has active problem)

**Event Strategy:** Direct revenue focus
- Attend events with high CFO/finance operator concentration
- Bitcoin + fintech conferences where cross-border payments are relevant
- ROI measured by: qualified leads, sales conversations, pipeline

---

### TeamPay ← **CRITICAL CONTEXT**

**Core Product:** B2B finance platform (corporate spend, AP, workflows)
- Primary revenue driver
- Traditional enterprise SaaS sales motion
- Medium-long sales cycle, finance-led buying

**BTC Rewards Card:** Strategic wedge into Bitcoin ecosystem
- **NOT a primary revenue driver**
- **Purpose:** Build Bitcoin-native brand, ecosystem credibility, logo acquisition, social proof
- **Top-of-funnel lever:** Opens doors to broader TeamPay B2B platform adoption

**Event Strategy:** **Ecosystem positioning > near-term revenue**
- Flagship Bitcoin events are HIGH-VALUE for TeamPay brand building even if indirect revenue
- BTC card positions TeamPay as Bitcoin-native across ecosystem
- Long-term play: Ecosystem credibility converts to B2B platform customers

**Key Insight (Session Correction):**
Initial analysis treated TeamPay as weak fit for Bitcoin events (traditional spend management platform). Corrected understanding: BTC rewards card is ecosystem wedge, fundamentally changing event strategy. **Flagship Bitcoin events (Las Vegas, Hong Kong, Prague, LABITCONF) now offer dual-channel value: Bitwage direct revenue + TeamPay ecosystem wedge.**

---

### Mining / Bitcoin Foundation

**Product:** Mining operations, energy integration, circular economies, ecosystem development

**Target Customers:**
- Bitcoin miners, energy operators
- Municipalities, policymakers
- Infrastructure builders, NGOs

**Sales Cycle:** Long, relationship-driven, strategic partnerships (not transactional)

**Event Strategy:** Credibility anchor and ecosystem access
- Mining-specific conferences (Mining Disrupt)
- Foundation attends ecosystem/NGO events for mission alignment
- ROI measured by: relationships, policy access, ecosystem positioning

---

## 3. Strategic Philosophy: Ecosystem Penetration > Short-Term Revenue

**Core Principle:**
Bitcoin events are strategic for **ecosystem positioning and brand legitimacy**, not just immediate ROI. This is especially true for TeamPay's BTC rewards card.

**Dual-Channel Value at Flagship Events:**
- **Bitwage:** Direct revenue from CFOs, finance ops, cross-border payment buyers
- **TeamPay:** Ecosystem wedge via BTC card visibility, Bitcoin-native logo acquisition, social proof

**Why This Matters:**
- TeamPay's BTC card is **top-of-funnel ecosystem lever**, not direct revenue product
- Bitcoin ecosystem credibility opens doors to broader B2B platform adoption
- Flagship events justify higher budget allocation when dual-channel value is recognized

**Long-Term Play:**
- Acquire Bitcoin-native logos (social proof)
- Build brand legitimacy in Bitcoin community
- Convert ecosystem credibility into TeamPay B2B platform customers over 12-18 months

**LATAM Efficiency:**
- LATAM events (LABITCONF México $5k, Argentina $4k) deliver dual-channel presence at 1/5 cost of global flagships
- 9 of 23 events are LATAM, aligning with geographic focus and budget constraints

---

## 4. Evaluation Framework

### Event Evaluation Criteria

**1. Audience Fit** - Does event concentrate target buyers/influencers?
- **Bitwage:** CFOs, payroll operators, cross-border payment buyers
- **TeamPay:** Bitcoin-native companies, founders, CFOs (for ecosystem wedge)
- **Mining:** Miners, energy operators, infrastructure builders

**2. Business Relevance**
- Direct revenue potential (qualified leads, sales conversations)
- Indirect pipeline (relationships, partnerships, ecosystem credibility)
- Strategic value (market entry, brand positioning, ecosystem access)
- **TeamPay-specific: Ecosystem wedge value** (BTC card visibility, Bitcoin-native brand, logo acquisition)

**3. Lead Potential Reality Check**
- Buyer concentration (decision-makers vs. general attendees)
- Sales cycle alignment (short-cycle vs. long-term relationship)
- Competitor presence and noise level

**4. Budget Efficiency**
- Cost vs. expected return (given $25k cap)
- Geographic strategic value (LATAM priority)

### Tagging Structure

Each event assigned:
- **PRIMARY:** Bitwage / TeamPay / Mining / Foundation/Org / Other
- **SECONDARY:** (if applicable) secondary business unit fit
- **Justification:** 1-line signal-heavy rationale
- **Recommendation:** Attend / Skip / Monitor / Downgrade

---

## 5. ROI & Budget Framing

### ROI Types

**1. Direct Revenue ROI**
- Qualified leads, sales conversations, closed deals
- Bitwage: CFO/finance ops at Bitcoin+fintech events
- Mining: Operators/infrastructure buyers at mining conferences

**2. Ecosystem Wedge ROI (TeamPay-specific)**
- Bitcoin-native brand building
- Logo acquisition from Bitcoin-native companies
- Social proof in Bitcoin community
- Long-term: converts to TeamPay B2B platform customers

**3. Foundation / Mission ROI**
- Ecosystem development, NGO partnerships, policy access
- Separate budget, no commercial ROI expectation

### Budget Framing

**Dual-Channel Justification:**
- Flagship Bitcoin events (Las Vegas, Hong Kong, Prague, LABITCONF) deliver **Bitwage direct revenue + TeamPay ecosystem wedge**
- Combined ROI significantly strengthens business case vs. single-channel events

**LATAM Efficiency:**
- LATAM events deliver 3-5x cost efficiency vs. global flagships
- LABITCONF México ($5k) + Argentina ($4k) = dual-channel presence at $9k total vs. Las Vegas $25k

**Foundation Budget Separation:**
- 11 events tagged Foundation-only (Adopting Bitcoin, Women in Bitcoin, circular economy summits)
- Critical: Ensure Foundation budget separate from Bitwage/TeamPay/Mining commercial budgets
- Maintain clear distinction between ecosystem mission and commercial objectives

## 6. Current State Summary

### What's Been Analyzed

**Scope:** 23 active events from Master Event Matrix 2026 (LATAM + global)
**Approach:** Fresh evaluation independent of existing priority ratings
**Source Data:** /Users/frojas/Downloads/Master Event Matrix 2026 - Bitcoin Events.csv

### Final Recommendations

**Attend (7 events, $80k total):**
1. **Bitcoin 2026 Las Vegas** (Apr 27-29) - $25k - **Bitwage + TeamPay co-primary**
2. **Bitcoin 2026 Hong Kong** (Aug 27-28) - $15k - **Bitwage + TeamPay co-primary**
3. **BTC Prague** (Jun 11-13) - $15k - **Bitwage + TeamPay co-primary**
4. **LABITCONF México** (Jan 23) - $5k - **Bitwage + TeamPay co-primary**
5. **LABITCONF Argentina** (Nov TBD) - $4k - **Bitwage + TeamPay co-primary**
6. **EmergingTech Week Panama** (Apr 9-16) - $8k - Bitwage primary, TeamPay secondary
7. **Mining Disrupt Miami** (Jul 21-23) - $8k - Mining primary

**Monitor (2 events, $21k if budget allows):**
- Bitcoin India (Mar TBD) - $6k - Emerging market exploratory
- Bitcoin 2026 MENA Abu Dhabi (Dec TBD) - $15k - Mining/MENA ecosystem

**Foundation-Only (11 events, separate budget):**
- Adopting Bitcoin series (El Salvador, South Africa, Netherlands)
- Women in Bitcoin series (5 events across LATAM/EU/Asia)
- Circular economy summits, NGO partnerships

**Skip (3 events):**
- Bitcoin Medellin - Weak B2B signals
- Bitcoin Midwest Ohio - Low ROI
- Bitcoin Bali - Too early-stage

### Key Findings

1. **Dual-channel opportunities:** 5 events tagged Bitwage + TeamPay co-primary (Las Vegas, Hong Kong, Prague, LABITCONF México/Argentina)
2. **LATAM efficiency:** 9 of 23 events are LATAM, delivering cost-efficient regional presence
3. **Budget reality check:** Current matrix shows ~$160k estimated; recommended $80k immediate commitments (Tier 1-3), up to $101k with monitoring events
4. **Strategic shift:** Dual Bitwage+TeamPay positioning strengthens ROI justification significantly vs. original Bitwage-only framing

---

## 7. Open Questions (Outstanding Stakeholder Alignment)

1. **Budget authority:** Confirm $80k Tier 1-3 immediate commitment vs. phased approval
2. **Dual-channel coordination:** Agree on co-branded Bitwage+TeamPay booth strategy at Las Vegas, Hong Kong, Prague?
3. **TeamPay ecosystem strategy:** Align on BTC card positioning goals - logo acquisition targets, social proof metrics, partnership KPIs?
4. **Las Vegas/Prague negotiation:** Prefer shared booth (dual-channel) or separate scaled presence to fit $25k cap?
5. **Foundation budget:** Confirm Foundation separately funds all 11 ecosystem events so commercial budgets aren't diluted
6. **LATAM priority:** If budget forces choice between México and Argentina, prioritize México (Q1, larger market) over Argentina (Q4, secondary)?

## 8. Next Session Scope (Expansion Areas)

### 1. Competitor Landscape Analysis

**Goal:** Understand competitive dynamics at each event

**Questions to Answer:**
- Who else is targeting Bitcoin ecosystem? (payments companies, fintech platforms, spend management competitors)
- Which events have high competitor concentration?
- Where are differentiation opportunities?
- Which events are "must-attend" because competitors will be there (defensive positioning)?
- Which events offer "blue ocean" opportunities (low competitor noise, high buyer access)?

**Competitive Positioning Strategy:**
- Per-event competitive analysis
- Messaging/positioning to differentiate from competitors
- Booth placement and sponsorship tier recommendations vs. competitors

---

### 2. Deepen Event-Specific Strategies

**For each "Attend" event (7 events), develop:**
- **Messaging/positioning:** What's the story per event? (Bitwage cross-border payroll? TeamPay BTC card? Both?)
- **Booth/sponsorship tiers:** Which tier maximizes ROI within budget cap?
- **Pre-event outreach:** Who to target before event (speakers, sponsors, attendees)?
- **Success metrics/KPIs:** How do we measure success per event? (leads, logos, partnerships, media)
- **Team staffing:** Who attends from each business unit? Travel/logistics planning?

**Priority Events for Deepening:**
- Las Vegas (Apr) - Must finalize ASAP, Q1 commitment
- LABITCONF México (Jan) - Deadline approaching
- Hong Kong (Aug) - APAC expansion strategy

---

### 3. Alternative Event Discovery

**Goal:** Identify events NOT in current matrix that may be higher ROI

**Categories to Explore:**
- **CFO/finance ops conferences** (for TeamPay core B2B platform, not just BTC card)
  - AFP (Association for Financial Professionals)
  - CFO Summit series
  - Finance Transformation conferences
- **LATAM fintech events** beyond Bitcoin focus
  - Finnosummit (LATAM fintech)
  - CIAB Febraban (Brazil banking/fintech)
  - Colombia Fintech
- **Regional Bitcoin events** with strong ecosystem value
  - Baltic Honeybadger
  - Plan B Forum (El Salvador)
  - Africa Bitcoin Conference

---

### 4. Timeline Refinement

**Goal:** Detailed Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 execution roadmap

**Timeline Elements:**
- **Registration deadlines** and early bird pricing windows per event
- **Booth/sponsorship negotiation** timeline (when to lock, escalation points)
- **Team travel/logistics** planning (flights, hotels, visa requirements for LATAM/APAC)
- **Pre-event outreach** campaigns (4-6 weeks before event)
- **Post-event follow-up** strategy (within 48 hours, 1 week, 1 month nurture)

**Q1 Immediate Actions (from current analysis):**
1. LABITCONF México ($5k) - January event, deadline approaching
2. EmergingTech Panama ($8k) - Early bird pricing window
3. Bitcoin Las Vegas ($25k) - Secure sponsorship, negotiate shared Bitwage+TeamPay booth

## 10. Key Reminders (Critical Context - Do NOT Lose)

### TeamPay Positioning ← **MOST CRITICAL**
- **TeamPay BTC rewards card is ecosystem wedge, NOT direct revenue driver**
- Card purpose: Build Bitcoin-native brand, ecosystem credibility, logo acquisition, social proof
- Top-of-funnel lever: Opens doors to broader TeamPay B2B platform adoption over time
- **Event strategy: Ecosystem positioning > near-term revenue**

### Dual-Channel Value
- **Flagship Bitcoin events offer dual-channel value:**
  - Bitwage: Direct revenue from CFOs/finance ops
  - TeamPay: Ecosystem wedge via BTC card visibility, Bitcoin-native brand building
- This dual-channel positioning significantly strengthens ROI justification vs. single-channel framing

### Strategic Philosophy
- **Ecosystem penetration > short-term revenue** for Bitcoin channel strategy
- Bitcoin events are about brand legitimacy and ecosystem positioning, not just immediate ROI
- Long-term play: Bitcoin ecosystem credibility converts to TeamPay B2B customers (12-18 month horizon)

### Budget Constraints
- **$25k per-event cap** - negotiate scaled presence or shared booths for expensive events
- Overall constrained budget - prioritize dual-channel events for maximum ROI
- **LATAM events deliver 3-5x cost efficiency** vs. global flagships

### Foundation Separation
- **11 events tagged Foundation-only** (Adopting Bitcoin, Women in Bitcoin, circular economy)
- Ensure Foundation budget separate from commercial budgets
- Foundation mission ≠ commercial ROI expectation

### Geographic Priority
- **LATAM focus** for cost efficiency and strategic market access
- 9 of 23 events are LATAM
- México > Argentina if budget forces choice
