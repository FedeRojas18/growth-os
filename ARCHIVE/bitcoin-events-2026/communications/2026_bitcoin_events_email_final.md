---

Team,

**We need to lock Q1-Q2 event budgets by mid-February—here's the analysis for 9 Bitcoin and stablecoin events (North America + LATAM only) totaling $77k, with immediate action items.**

## Strategic Context

Leadership is finalizing Q1-Q2 2026 budgets now. I've completed a targeted analysis of Q1-Q2 Bitcoin and stablecoin/fintech events in North America and LATAM through the lens of Bitwage, TeamPay, and Mining business unit fit. Bottom line: **recommend attending 9 events totaling $77k**.

**Key Opportunity:** Stablecoin events are strategically aligned with the Bitcoin ecosystem and offer high Bitwage ROI. LATAM stablecoin adoption is accelerating for cross-border payments—our core value proposition.

**Dual-Channel Value:** Flagship Bitcoin events (Las Vegas, LABITCONF México) deliver combined Bitwage+TeamPay value (direct revenue + ecosystem wedge), significantly strengthening ROI justification.

### TeamPay Positioning

TeamPay's BTC rewards card is a strategic wedge into the Bitcoin ecosystem—designed to build brand legitimacy, ecosystem credibility, and acquire Bitcoin-native logos/customers. While the card itself doesn't drive immediate revenue, it positions TeamPay across the Bitcoin ecosystem and opens doors to broader B2B platform adoption over time.

**What This Means for Events:** Flagship Bitcoin events are high-priority for TeamPay from an ecosystem positioning standpoint. These events offer maximum concentration of Bitcoin-native companies, founders, and CFOs who value BTC rewards and will give TeamPay credibility, social proof, and logo acquisition.

**Implication:** Top Bitcoin events now carry dual-channel value (Bitwage direct revenue + TeamPay ecosystem wedge), significantly strengthening business case and ROI justification.

## Recommendations by Channel

### Bitwage (9 events - North America + LATAM only)

4. **EmergingTech Panama** (Apr) - LATAM strategic, blockchain/fintech convergence
5. **Bitcoin Las Vegas** (Apr) - Must attend, highest CFO/enterprise concentration
6. **LABITCONF México** (May) - Flagship LATAM Bitcoin, cost-efficient dual-channel presence
7. **MRC São Paulo** (May) - Premier LATAM payments conference, direct revenue path
8. **Stablecoin Conference LATAM** (Jun) - LATAM stablecoin momentum validation
9. **Mexico Blockchain Week** (Jun) - Bitcoin ecosystem, México market priority

### TeamPay (2 co-primary, 1 secondary - North America + LATAM only)

**Must-Attend Q1-Q2:**

### Foundation (11 events, separate budget)

Continue low-cost high-impact presence at Adopting Bitcoin (El Salvador, South Africa), Women in Bitcoin series, circular economy summits, NGO partnerships. Ensure these DO NOT consume Bitwage/TeamPay/Mining commercial budgets.

## Summary

Q1-Q2 Bitcoin and stablecoin events in North America and LATAM offer dual Bitwage+TeamPay ROI through combined direct revenue and ecosystem wedge positioning. Recommend **immediate commitment to all 3 tiers ($77k, 9 events)** with coordinated Bitwage+TeamPay presence to maximize combined value.

**Stablecoin events are strategically aligned with Bitcoin ecosystem and offer high Bitwage ROI for cross-border payments.** LATAM focus delivers 3-5x cost efficiency, and North America + LATAM geographic restriction aligns with our operating markets.

**Key Insights:**
- **Stablecoin Momentum:** Three Q1-Q2 stablecoin events validate accelerating LATAM stablecoin adoption for cross-border use cases
- **LATAM Efficiency:** 8 of 9 events are LATAM-based (only Las Vegas is US), offering strong cost efficiency ($26k for 4 LATAM touchpoints vs. $25k single flagship)
- **Dual-Channel Leverage:** Las Vegas and LABITCONF México deliver combined Bitwage + TeamPay value
- **Geographic Focus:** All events are in North America or LATAM markets where we actively operate
