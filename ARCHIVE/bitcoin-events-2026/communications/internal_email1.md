Team,

**We need to lock Q1-Q2 event budgets by mid-February—here's the analysis for 7 Bitcoin and stablecoin events (North America + LATAM only) totaling $77k, with immediate action items.**

## Strategic Context

Leadership is finalizing Q1-Q2 2026 budgets now. I've completed a targeted analysis of Q1-Q2 Bitcoin and stablecoin/fintech events in North America and LATAM through the lens of Bitwage, TeamPay, and Mining business unit fit. Bottom line: **recommend attending 7 events totaling $77k** (Tiers 1-3).

**Key Opportunity:** Stablecoin events are strategically aligned with the Bitcoin ecosystem and offer high Bitwage ROI. LATAM stablecoin adoption is accelerating for cross-border payments—our core value proposition.

**Dual-Channel Value:** Flagship Bitcoin events (Las Vegas, LABITCONF México) deliver combined Bitwage+TeamPay value (direct revenue + ecosystem wedge), significantly strengthening ROI justification.

### TeamPay Positioning

TeamPay's BTC rewards card is a strategic wedge into the Bitcoin ecosystem—designed to build brand legitimacy, ecosystem credibility, and acquire Bitcoin-native logos/customers. While the card itself doesn't drive immediate revenue, it positions TeamPay across the Bitcoin ecosystem and opens doors to broader B2B platform adoption over time.

**What This Means for Events:** Flagship Bitcoin events are high-priority for TeamPay from an ecosystem positioning standpoint. These events offer maximum concentration of Bitcoin-native companies, founders, and CFOs who value BTC rewards and will give TeamPay credibility, social proof, and logo acquisition.

**Implication:** Top Bitcoin events now carry dual-channel value (Bitwage direct revenue + TeamPay ecosystem wedge), significantly strengthening business case and ROI justification.

## Recommendations by Channel

### Bitwage (9 events - North America + LATAM only)

**Must-Attend Q1-Q2:**
1. **Stablecoin Brazil Forum** (Feb) - Direct cross-border payments alignment, Brazil market
2. **FinTech México Week** (Feb) - México fintech ecosystem, Yaydoo market synergy
3. **Fintech Americas Miami** (Mar) - LATAM fintech CFO concentration, stablecoin crossover
4. **EmergingTech Panama** (Apr) - LATAM strategic, blockchain/fintech convergence
5. **Bitcoin Las Vegas** (Apr) - Must attend, highest CFO/enterprise concentration
6. **LABITCONF México** (May) - Flagship LATAM Bitcoin, cost-efficient dual-channel presence
7. **MRC São Paulo** (May) - Premier LATAM payments conference, direct revenue path
8. **Stablecoin Conference LATAM** (Jun) - LATAM stablecoin momentum validation
9. **Mexico Blockchain Week** (Jun) - Bitcoin ecosystem, México market priority

**Rationale:** Bitwage has clear revenue path at all stablecoin and payments events. Stablecoin adoption in LATAM directly aligns with cross-border payment rails. Focus on North America and LATAM markets where we operate.

### TeamPay (2 co-primary, 1 secondary - North America + LATAM only)

**Must-Attend Q1-Q2:**
1. **Bitcoin Las Vegas** (Apr, co-primary) - Maximum BTC card visibility, Bitcoin-native CFOs/founders, logo acquisition at flagship event
2. **LABITCONF México** (May, co-primary) - Cost-efficient LATAM ecosystem presence, regional Bitcoin leaders, social proof at low cost
3. **EmergingTech Panama** (Apr, secondary) - Blockchain/fintech crossover, secondary BTC card positioning

**Rationale:** TeamPay's BTC rewards card transforms flagship Bitcoin events into high ecosystem value opportunities. These events offer maximum concentration of Bitcoin-native buyers in our operating markets (North America + LATAM) who value BTC rewards and will give TeamPay credibility, logos, and social proof. Co-sponsor/co-attend with Bitwage to maximize combined ROI.

### Mining (0 Q1-Q2 events)

**No Q1-Q2 events recommended.** Mining Disrupt Miami is Q3 (July). Defer to Q3 planning cycle.

### Foundation (11 events, separate budget)

Continue low-cost high-impact presence at Adopting Bitcoin (El Salvador, South Africa), Women in Bitcoin series, circular economy summits, NGO partnerships. Ensure these DO NOT consume Bitwage/TeamPay/Mining commercial budgets. Align on Foundation vs. commercial budget split.

## Key Insights

**Stablecoin Momentum:** Three separate Q1-Q2 stablecoin events (Brazil Forum, LATAM Conference, EMEA Amsterdam) validate accelerating LATAM stablecoin adoption for cross-border use cases—aligns perfectly with Bitwage's core value proposition.

**LATAM Efficiency:** 8 of 9 Q1-Q2 events are LATAM-based (only Las Vegas is US), offering strong cost efficiency. Stablecoin Brazil ($6k) + FinTech México Week ($8k) + MRC São Paulo ($6k) + Stablecoin LATAM ($6k) = $26k for 4 strategic LATAM touchpoints vs. single $25k Las Vegas flagship.

**Dual-Channel Leverage:** Las Vegas and LABITCONF México deliver combined Bitwage (direct revenue) + TeamPay (ecosystem wedge) value. This dual-channel positioning transforms events from "Bitwage-only" to "multi-business-unit strategic assets" and justifies higher budget allocation.

**Geographic Focus:** All events are in North America or LATAM markets where we actively operate, ensuring maximum strategic alignment and operational efficiency.

## Summary

Q1-Q2 Bitcoin and stablecoin events in North America and LATAM offer dual Bitwage+TeamPay ROI through combined direct revenue and ecosystem wedge positioning. Recommend **immediate commitment to all 3 tiers ($77k, 9 events)** with coordinated Bitwage+TeamPay presence to maximize combined value.

Stablecoin events are strategically aligned with Bitcoin ecosystem and offer high Bitwage ROI for cross-border payments. LATAM focus delivers 3-5x cost efficiency, and North America + LATAM geographic restriction aligns with our operating markets.
