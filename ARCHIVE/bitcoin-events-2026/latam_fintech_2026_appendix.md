## Notes

### Overlaps with Existing Bitcoin Analysis
- **Plan B Forum 2026** - Already analyzed in Bitcoin events; El Salvador flagship; high priority confirmed.
- **LabITconf** (likely same as LABITCONF) - Already analyzed; Argentina/México LABITCONF flagships; high priority confirmed.
- **Consensys** - Ethereum-focused but Bitcoin-adjacent; monitor for institutional blockchain/crypto audience overlap.
- **Cripto Latinfest** - May be alternate name for LabITconf or separate crypto event; clarify to avoid duplicate commitments.

### Geographic Concentration
- **México events:** 8+ events (FinTech México Week, Festival, Blockchain Week x2, Wealthtech, AI Unconference, Digital Bank, Finexban) - validates México as Yaydoo market priority
- **Brazil events:** 7+ events (Stablecoin Forum x3, São Paulo events, Merge, Fintouch, Insurtech) - confirms Brazil as largest LATAM market with strong fintech ecosystem
- **Multi-country series:** Banking Tech Summit (6 countries), Digital Bank (7 countries), Digital Assets Forum (3 countries) - potential for regional circuit efficiency

### Event Series/Patterns
- **Stablecoin focus:** 3 separate stablecoin events (Brazil Forum, Conference, Stableconf) - validates growing LATAM stablecoin adoption for cross-border payments
- **Banking Tech Summit series:** 6 events across Central America/Caribbean - potential circuit for Bitwage banking/payments audience
- **Digital Bank series:** 7 events across LATAM - corporate digital transformation theme; CFO audience likely
- **Blockchain Week series:** México, Bolivia, Panama, Blockchain Summit Latam - Bitcoin ecosystem positioning opportunities

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Validation:** Top 15-20 "High Relevance" events warrant quick calls with organizers to validate:
   - Dates (avoid overlaps with approved Bitcoin events)
   - Attendee profiles (CFO/finance ops concentration vs. developer/startup-only)
   - Sponsor tiers and costs (target $3k-8k LATAM range, up to $15k for premium multi-BU fit)

2. **Overlap Consolidation:** Clarify México event variants (FinTech México Week vs. Festival vs. Fintech Week vs. Misión) to avoid duplicate commitments.

3. **Series Circuit Strategy:** Banking Tech Summit (6 events) and Digital Bank (7 events) may offer series sponsorship discounts or multi-event packages—worth exploring for cost efficiency.

4. **Stablecoin Momentum:** Three separate stablecoin events suggest strong LATAM focus on stablecoin adoption for cross-border use cases—aligns perfectly with Bitwage's core value proposition.

5. **México Depth:** 8+ México events validates market as Yaydoo priority; consider concentrated México presence (3-4 events) vs. broad LATAM coverage.

6. **Next Steps:** This analysis flags opportunities only. Before any commitments:
   - Cross-reference dates with approved Bitcoin events (Las Vegas Apr, Hong Kong Aug, Prague Jun, LABITCONF México Jan, etc.)
   - Validate enterprise buyer concentration for top 10-15 events
   - Confirm no overlap/duplication with existing Foundation event portfolio (11 events)
   - Prioritize events offering dual Bitwage+Yaydoo fit for maximum ROI per event

---

**Analysis Methodology:** Pattern-matching based on event names only. No deep research, budget modeling, or website validation conducted. High relevance events require organizer validation before commitment.

**Integration:** This analysis complements the approved Bitcoin events portfolio ($80k-$101k, 7-9 events). LATAM Fintech events offer additional Bitwage cross-border opportunities and Yaydoo B2B expansion in México/Brazil priority markets.
