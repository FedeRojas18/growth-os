**Subject:** Q1-Q2 Event Budget Decision Needed by Feb 10 – $77k for 9 Events (North America + LATAM)

---

Team,

I'm requesting approval for a **$77k Q1–Q2 event budget** covering 9 Bitcoin and stablecoin events in North America and LATAM. With multiple events starting in February, early bird pricing windows are closing soon.

This plan prioritizes flagship Bitcoin events with dual Bitwage + TeamPay presence, complemented by stablecoin-focused LATAM events aligned with our cross-border payments strategy. All events are in markets where we actively operate.

## The Ask

Please confirm the following:

- [ ] **Approve $77k total budget for Q1–Q2 events** (9 events, North America + LATAM only)
- [ ] **Authorize February event registrations** (Stablecoin Brazil, FinTech México Week)
- [ ] **Confirm participation in Las Vegas** (Apr, $25k) **and LABITCONF México** (May, $5k)

## What This Covers

**9 events across Feb–Jun 2026 ($77k total) - North America + LATAM only**

| Tier | Events | Investment |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Tier 1 – Must-Attend Bitcoin** | Las Vegas ($25k), LABITCONF México ($5k) | **$30k** |
| **Tier 2 – Stablecoin / LATAM** | Stablecoin Brazil ($6k), FinTech México Week ($8k), MRC São Paulo ($6k), Stablecoin LATAM ($6k) | **$26k** |
| **Tier 3 – Strategic Add-Ons** | EmergingTech Panama ($8k), Fintech Americas Miami ($8k), Mexico Blockchain Week ($5k) | **$21k** |
| **Total** | **9 events** | **$77k** |

## Why This Matters

Stablecoin events directly support Bitwage's cross-border payroll and payments motion, particularly as LATAM adoption accelerates. Flagship Bitcoin events (Las Vegas, LABITCONF México) deliver dual ROI: direct Bitwage pipeline from CFOs and finance leaders, plus TeamPay ecosystem positioning via the BTC rewards card. LATAM-first execution provides ~3–5x cost efficiency compared to comparable global events, and geographic focus on North America + LATAM aligns with markets where we operate. Q1–Q2 scope aligns with current budgeting and execution planning.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Budget approval by Feb 10** ($77k, 9 events)
2. **Register February events immediately:**
   - Stablecoin Brazil Forum (Feb 10–11)
   - FinTech México Week (Feb 23–27)
3. **Lock Q2 flagship event participation** by end of February:
   - Bitcoin Las Vegas (Apr 27-29)
   - LABITCONF México (May 8-9)
4. **Confirm stablecoin sponsorship tiers** and attendee profiles

## Q1–Q2 2026 Event Calendar

**February:** Stablecoin Brazil Forum (10–11), FinTech México Week (23–27)

**March:** Fintech Americas Miami (24–26), Bitcoin India (monitor)
