# Paystand Bitcoin Ecosystem Channel — Context & Goals (2026)

## 1. What the Bitcoin Ecosystem Channel Is

The Bitcoin Ecosystem Channel is Paystand's GTM motion for generating pipeline, building brand credibility, and acquiring customers through the Bitcoin and stablecoin ecosystem. It operates across Bitwage, TeamPay, Mining, and Foundation — coordinating presence at high-signal events where our buyers and partners concentrate. This is not an events calendar. It is a structured go-to-market channel with budget discipline, measurable outcomes, and cross-unit coordination.

## 2. Why This Channel Matters Now

Three forces are converging in 2026:

- **Stablecoin adoption is accelerating in LATAM.** Cross-border payments via stablecoin rails are moving from pilot to production — directly validating Bitwage's core value proposition.
- **Bitcoin ecosystem credibility opens enterprise doors.** TeamPay's BTC rewards card positions the broader B2B platform inside the Bitcoin-native community, creating a wedge into companies that traditional fintech outreach doesn't reach.
- **LATAM cost efficiency is real.** Regional events deliver 3-5x better cost-per-lead than global flagships, and they concentrate the buyers we actually sell to.

The window is now. Competitors are entering these spaces. Early ecosystem presence compounds over time; late entry does not.

## 3. Core Mandate

- Generate qualified pipeline and revenue opportunities for Bitwage within Paystand
- Build ecosystem credibility and acquire Bitcoin-native logos for TeamPay (BTC rewards card as wedge into broader B2B platform adoption)
- Support Mining relationship development and infrastructure ecosystem positioning
- Maintain Foundation ecosystem presence on a separate, non-commercial budget

## 4. Business Unit Fit

**Bitwage** — Cross-border payroll and contractor payments. Target buyer is the CFO or finance operator with active FX friction. Short-medium sales cycle, pain-driven. Events selected for high concentration of finance decision-makers in LATAM and cross-border payments contexts.

**TeamPay** — B2B finance platform (corporate spend, AP, workflows). The BTC rewards card is not a revenue product — it is an ecosystem wedge. It builds Bitcoin-native brand legitimacy, acquires logos, and generates social proof that converts to B2B platform customers over 12-18 months. Flagship Bitcoin events are high-priority for this motion.

**Mining** — Infrastructure and energy operations. Long sales cycle, relationship-driven. Channel supports strategic partnerships and operator access at mining-specific conferences. Secondary priority in Q1-Q2.

**Foundation** — Non-commercial ecosystem presence at community events (Adopting Bitcoin, Women in Bitcoin, circular economy summits). Separate budget. Does not consume commercial event dollars.

## 5. How Paystand Wins

- **Flagship Bitcoin events** (Las Vegas, LABITCONF) deliver concentrated buyer access and dual-channel value — Bitwage pipeline plus TeamPay ecosystem positioning in a single investment.
- **Stablecoin and LATAM fintech events** produce direct Bitwage ROI through CFO-dense audiences aligned with cross-border payments.
- **High-signal only.** We attend events where our buyers are, not events where Bitcoin is mentioned. Every event must justify its cost with a clear path to pipeline, logos, or strategic relationships.

## 6. Success Metrics (2026)

- Qualified leads generated per event (target: 15-25 per flagship, 8-12 per regional)
- Pipeline influenced for Bitwage and Paystand (tracked per event, 90-day attribution)
- Bitcoin-native logos acquired through TeamPay wedge (target: 5-10 per flagship event)
- Partner and ecosystem introductions routed into Paystand
- Cost-per-qualified-lead by event tier (benchmark: Tier 1 under $1,500, Tier 2 under $800, Tier 3 under $600)
- Post-event conversion rate (lead to opportunity, 30/60/90 day)

## 7. Operating Principles

1. **Ecosystem-first, ROI-driven.** Brand presence without pipeline is a cost center.
2. **Dual-channel or don't go.** Flagship events must deliver value for both Bitwage and TeamPay.
3. **TeamPay wedge + Bitwage revenue.** The BTC card opens doors; Bitwage closes deals.
4. **LATAM efficiency advantage.** Prioritize regional events that deliver 3-5x better unit economics.
5. **Small team, high leverage.** We staff lean and prepare thoroughly — pre-event outreach, targeted meetings, fast follow-up.
6. **Events must produce numbers, not vibes.** Every event gets a lead target, a follow-up plan, and a post-event review.
7. **Foundation budget stays separate.** Mission-driven events do not dilute commercial spending.

## 8. Near-Term Focus (Q1-Q2 2026)

- **9 priority events** across Feb-Jun, totaling **$77K** (Tier 1: $30K, Tier 2: $26K, Tier 3: $21K)
- **Tier 1 (must-attend):** Bitcoin 2026 Las Vegas ($25K), LABITCONF Mexico ($5K)
- **Tier 2 (direct revenue):** Stablecoin Brazil, FinTech Mexico Week, MRC Sao Paulo, Stablecoin LATAM
- **Tier 3 (strategic):** EmergingTech Panama, Fintech Americas Miami, Mexico Blockchain Week
- **Budget approval deadline:** February 10, 2026
- **Immediate registrations:** Stablecoin Brazil (Feb 10-11), FinTech Mexico Week (Feb 23-27)

## 9. Key Open Questions

- **Budget ownership:** How is the $77K allocated across Paystand, Bitwage, and TeamPay budgets?
- **Event prioritization trade-offs:** If budget contracts, which tier gets cut first? Mexico vs. Brazil priority?
- **Sales follow-up and lead routing:** Who owns post-event lead processing? What is the handoff from events to sales?
- **Sponsorship vs. guerrilla model:** Which events justify paid sponsorship vs. attend-only with targeted meetings?
- **TeamPay KPIs:** What are the specific logo acquisition and ecosystem credibility targets for 2026?
- **Dual-channel booth coordination:** Shared Bitwage+TeamPay booth at flagships, or separate presence?
