## Strategic Fit Assessment

### Audience Overlap
Hawksburn is entering the LATAM mining market with a $30M facility acquisition. They will need:
- Cross-border vendor payments for Paraguay operations
- Potential multi-country expansion (mining infrastructure typically spans multiple LATAM markets)
- Operational infrastructure for a new market entry

Their needs align directly with Bitwage's cross-border payment rails and potentially Mining BU's operational relationships.

### Why They Would Partner
- **Operational necessity:** New entrant to LATAM needs payment infrastructure from day one
- **Cost efficiency:** Stablecoin rails can reduce FX friction on vendor payments in Paraguay
- **Speed to market:** Bitwage's existing LATAM infrastructure vs. building from scratch
- **Credibility:** Partnership with established LATAM fintech infrastructure provider

### Why We Would Partner
- **Mining ecosystem access:** Direct relationship with well-capitalized mining fund entering LATAM
- **Revenue opportunity:** Cross-border vendor payments are an immediate use case
- **Network effects:** Singapore-based fund likely has connections to other Asian mining capital entering LATAM
- **Reference customer:** Mining fund using Bitwage validates our mining sector positioning

### Partnership Type
**Integration + Referral hybrid**
- Immediate: Bitwage as vendor payment rails for Paraguay facility
- Future: Referral relationship for other mining operations in their portfolio/network

### Competitive Considerations
- As a new LATAM entrant, they likely don't have existing payment infrastructure partnerships
- Bitfarms (seller) may have had existing vendors but Hawksburn starts fresh
- No known competitor relationships (advantage of new market entry)

## Mutual Value Proposition

### For Hawksburn Capital
- Immediate solution for Paraguay vendor payments without building local banking relationships
- Same-day settlement on cross-border payments to local vendors
- 3-5% FX savings vs. traditional bank wires
- Single platform if they expand to other LATAM mining markets
- Compliant infrastructure for institutional-grade operations

### For Bitwage/Mining BU
- Mining sector reference customer with institutional credibility
- Direct revenue from vendor payment volume
- Foot in the door with Singapore mining capital ecosystem
- Case study for "mining ops cross-border payments" use case
- Potential intro to other mining operations in their network

## Intro Script

> Hi [Name], I lead partnerships at Bitwage — we provide cross-border payment infrastructure for companies operating in LATAM. I noticed Hawksburn's acquisition of the Bitfarms Paraguay facility and thought we could help: running mining operations in Paraguay means vendor payments in local currency, and our stablecoin rails can handle that same-day with better FX than traditional banks. Would you be open to a quick call to discuss how we support mining operations in LATAM?

---

## Path to Intro

**Warm Connection:**
- Check if any existing mining contacts have connections to Singapore funds
- Paraguay mining community may have insight on Hawksburn's local team
- Bitfarms contacts may know who to reach at Hawksburn

**Best Channel:** Email (if contact found) or LinkedIn to operations/finance lead

**Timing Consideration:**
- Deal just announced — they're actively setting up LATAM operations now
- Pre-transition window is ideal (before they establish other vendor payment workflows)
- Target outreach within next 2 weeks while operationally planning

---

## Next Step

**Action:** Research Hawksburn Capital leadership on LinkedIn; identify Head of Operations or CFO-equivalent for fund
**Owner:** [TBD]
**By When:** January 31, 2026

## Risk / Considerations

- Singapore-based HQ may mean decision-making is offshore, harder to reach
- Institutional fund may have existing banking relationships they prefer
- Paraguay-specific — may not expand to other LATAM markets (limits growth)
- Unknown fund size/AUM — may be smaller than expected
- Mining operations often have existing vendor payment workflows (inertia)

---

## Notes

- Signal source: Agent 1 Monday digest (Jan 28, 2026)
- Bitfarms is exiting Paraguay — suggests market dynamics worth understanding
- $30M acquisition indicates meaningful capital commitment
- "Sympatheia Power Fund" name suggests energy/infrastructure focus beyond just mining
- Paraguay has favorable energy costs for mining (hydroelectric) — may expand
