## Strategic Fit Assessment

### Audience Overlap
Circle's enterprise customers are fintechs and companies using stablecoin rails for cross-border payments — directly overlapping with Bitwage's target market. Their Brazil expansion and fintech partnerships signal investment in exactly the markets where Bitwage operates.

Overlap is high:
- Both serve companies with cross-border payment needs
- Both focused on LATAM (Circle expanding Brazil presence)
- Both sell to fintechs as infrastructure providers

### Why They Would Partner
- **Product completeness:** USDC is a payment rail, but Circle doesn't do payroll/contractor payments. Bitwage adds a use case to their ecosystem.
- **Customer retention:** Offering payroll capability keeps customers in the USDC ecosystem
- **Market penetration:** Bitwage's LATAM presence helps Circle's Brazil expansion
- **Enterprise validation:** Bitwage using USDC at scale validates their cross-border use case

### Why We Would Partner
- **Credibility by association:** Circle is the most legitimate stablecoin issuer; partnership signals enterprise-grade positioning
- **Technical integration:** USDC as native rail for Bitwage payments
- **Co-marketing:** Joint content, case studies, event presence
- **Customer referrals:** Circle customers needing payroll capability → Bitwage
- **Enterprise access:** Circle's enterprise relationships could open doors

### Partnership Type
**Integration + Co-marketing + Referral**
- Technical: Bitwage built on USDC rails (likely already using)
- Marketing: Joint case studies, event co-presence, content
- Referral: Circle recommends Bitwage for payroll use cases

### Competitive Considerations
- Circle partners with many payment companies — we'd be one of several, not exclusive
- They may already have payroll partners (research needed)
- Potential conflict if Circle builds payroll capability directly (unlikely given focus)
- Bitso partnership announced — may be their primary LATAM fintech partner

---

## Mutual Value Proposition

### For Circle
- Add contractor/payroll payments to USDC use case portfolio
- Deepen LATAM market penetration through Bitwage's presence
- Enterprise customer success story ("Companies use USDC via Bitwage for LATAM payroll")
- Strengthen "compliant cross-border payments" positioning with regulated partner
- Referral path for USDC enterprise customers with payroll needs

### For Bitwage
- Credibility association with most regulated stablecoin issuer
- Potential co-marketing budget and content support
- Access to Circle's enterprise customer base
- Technical support and potentially preferred pricing on USDC infrastructure
- Joint presence at enterprise events (Stablecoin Brazil, etc.)

## Intro Script

> Hi [Name], I lead partnerships at Bitwage — we're the leading platform for paying contractors in LATAM using stablecoin rails, and USDC is central to our infrastructure. With Circle's expanded Brazil presence and fintech partnerships, I thought there might be an opportunity to collaborate: we're solving the contractor payment use case for companies already in or entering the USDC ecosystem. Would you be open to exploring what a partnership could look like?

---

## Path to Intro

**Warm Connection:**
- Check if existing Bitwage/Paystand contacts have Circle relationships
- Stablecoin Brazil event (Feb 10-11) — Circle likely attending/sponsoring
- Bitso partnership — could Bitso intro if relationship exists?
- Bitcoin/fintech events where both companies present

**Best Channel:**
- Warm intro via mutual contact (preferred)
- Event networking (Stablecoin Brazil is 2 weeks away)
- Cold LinkedIn to LATAM or Partnerships lead (backup)

**Timing Consideration:**
- Brazil expansion just announced — they're actively building LATAM partnerships
- Feb 2 Brazil stablecoin regulations create urgency for compliant partners
- Stablecoin Brazil event (Feb 10-11) is natural meeting point

---

## Next Step

**Action:**
1. Research Circle's LATAM team lead and VP Partnerships on LinkedIn
2. Check if any warm intro paths exist through current network
3. Explore Stablecoin Brazil attendee/speaker list for Circle presence

**Owner:** [TBD]
**By When:** February 3, 2026 (before Stablecoin Brazil)

---

## Risk / Considerations

- **Scale mismatch:** Circle is much larger — we may be a small partner in their ecosystem
- **Existing partners:** They may already have payroll partners we'd compete with
- **Enterprise focus:** Circle increasingly focused on large enterprise; Bitwage mid-market focus may not align
- **Partnership velocity:** Large company = slow partnership process
- **Bitso relationship:** If Bitso is their primary LATAM partner, may create channel conflict

---

## Notes

- Signal source: Agent 1 Monday digest (Jan 28, 2026)
- Circle filed S-1 in 2024 — IPO timeline uncertain but they're operating at public-company scale
- USDC is ~$50B market cap — dominant in regulated/compliant stablecoin market
- Feb 2 Brazil regs make compliant stablecoin infrastructure more valuable
- Circle + Bitso partnership suggests they're building LATAM ecosystem partnerships
- Stablecoin Brazil (Feb 10-11) is immediate opportunity for in-person connection
