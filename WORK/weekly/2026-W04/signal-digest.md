## Thesis Candidates (for Segment Thesis Selector)

### 1. LABITCONF 2026 Pre-Event Targeting (High Priority)
- **Signal:** LABITCONF ₿2B announced for May 8, 2026 in Mexico City with business focus
- **Why it's a thesis:** Concentrated audience of Bitcoin-native companies, LATAM fintech operators, and CFOs at a single event. Pre-event outreach window of ~14 weeks. Dual-channel opportunity (TeamPay logos + Bitwage pipeline).

- **Best triggers:** Event presence, Community activity

### 2. Brazil Stablecoin Regulation Catalyst (High Priority)

## Dropped Signals (for transparency)

| Signal | Source | Reason Dropped |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| "Bitcoin price movements" | Multiple | No company/person; general market news |
| "MSCI decision on BTC treasury companies" | Bitcoin Magazine | Index news; no direct targeting opportunity |
| "Tesla unchanged BTC holdings" | Yahoo Finance | No change = no trigger; no conversion path |
| "Florida Bitcoin reserve bill" | TheStreet | Government/policy; outside targeting scope |
| "MicroStrategy latest purchase" | Multiple | Already maximum exposure; no new opportunity |
| "Generic LATAM nearshoring trends" | Multiple | Trend without specific company signals |

## Signals Flagged for Ecosystem Guide (Interesting but Not Actionable)

These go to `knowledge-base/ecosystem-guide.md` as watch items:

1. **Brazil regulatory clarity creating market opportunity** — Too broad for immediate targeting, but should inform Q1 thesis development
2. **Paraguay as mining hub consolidating** — HIVE expanding while Bitfarms exits; market consolidation pattern worth watching
3. **CFO sentiment on crypto** — Deloitte survey shows 99% of CFOs expect to use crypto; macro tailwind but not specific targets

---

## Recommendations for Human Review

### Highlighted Thesis Candidates
1. **LABITCONF 2026 Pre-Event** — Strongest signal. Clear event date (May 8), business focus, speaker lists coming. Recommend prioritizing if speaker roster published this week.
2. **Brazil Stablecoin Regulation** — Time-sensitive (Feb 2 effective date). Window to reach companies before compliance crunch.

### Borderline Signals (Kept but Flagged)
- **UY3 funding** — Kept because funding round is clear trigger, but need to verify they have cross-border payroll needs (credit infrastructure is adjacent)
- **Riot Platforms CFO** — Kept because exec transition creates window, but large mining company may have in-house solutions

### Questions for Strategic Input
1. Should we prioritize TeamPay targets (BTC treasury companies) or Bitwage targets (funded LATAM fintechs) this week?
2. Is the Feb 2 Brazil regulation date urgent enough to make it the primary thesis?
3. Should LABITCONF pre-event targeting start now (14 weeks out) or wait for full speaker list?
