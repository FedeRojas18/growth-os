## Target Enrichment Notes

### Tier 1 (Highest Priority — Strong Trigger + Clear Buyer)

| Company | Why Tier 1 | Outreach Angle |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Pomelo** | $55M Series C + explicit cross-border expansion + stablecoin launch | "Your stablecoin credit card launch aligns with Bitwage's LATAM rails" |
| **Plata** | $250M raised + announcing payroll solutions + Colombia expansion | "As you launch payroll products and expand to Colombia, cross-border contractor payments become critical" |
| **UY3** | New round negotiating + Brazil Feb 2 regulations = urgency | "Brazil's Feb 2 stablecoin regs create compliance requirements—Bitwage is positioned" |

### Tier 2 (Strong Trigger — Needs Buyer Research)

| Company | Why Tier 2 | Research Needed |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Klar** | $190M raised + Bineo acquisition + scaling ops | Find CFO or VP Ops contact |
| **Ualá** | $366M raised + 3-country ops + 1,500 employees | Identify Head of People or Finance Ops |
| **Kapital** | CFO Fernando Sandoval identified + multi-country | Verify current contact info |

### Tier 3 (Valid Trigger — Smaller or Secondary BU)

| Company | Why Tier 3 | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Magie** | Smaller (30 employees) but funded + scaling | May not have immediate cross-border needs |
| **DDC Enterprise** | TeamPay fit, not Bitwage primary | Strong BTC treasury signal |
| **Bitcoin Treasury Corp** | TeamPay fit; CEO presenting at conference | Warm intro via event context |

---

## Skipped Companies (Transparency Log)

| Company | Reason Skipped |
|---------|----------------|
| **Nubank** | Too large (enterprise); likely has in-house solutions |
| **Mercado Pago** | Too large (enterprise); has MELI Dólar stablecoin |
| **Bitso** | Crypto exchange, not fintech building cross-border payroll |
| **Rappi** | Delivery/super app; not in targeting scope |

---

## Research Notes

### Sources Used
- Crunchbase for funding data
- TechCrunch, Fintech Futures, CrowdfundInsider for announcements
- LinkedIn for employee counts and leadership
- Company websites for product info
- PitchBook profiles where available

### Key Findings
1. **Brazil Feb 2 regulation** creates urgency for UY3, Magie, iCred — compliance window
2. **Plata's payroll announcement** is a direct signal for Bitwage conversation
3. **Pomelo's stablecoin credit card** aligns perfectly with Bitwage positioning
4. **Multiple unicorns** (Plata $3.1B, Ualá $2.75B, Kapital $1.3B) — may have enterprise solutions but worth pursuing

### Gaps
- **Monet CEO** name not found; need LinkedIn research
- **iCred leadership** not identified; requires additional research
- **DDC Enterprise CFO** not identified; Hong Kong-based complicates outreach

### Recommendations for Tuesday
1. **Prioritize Tier 1** (Pomelo, Plata, UY3) for immediate messaging
2. **Research buyer names** for Tier 2 before Tuesday cutoff
3. **Add TeamPay targets** (DDC, Bitcoin Treasury Corp) as secondary list

---

## Buyer Personas Identified

| Title | Count | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|

| CFO | 2 | Kapital (Fernando Sandoval), American Bitcoin (TBD) |
| VP Finance | 1 | Klar (Juan Sarmiento) |
| Head of Ops/People | 0 | Need to research for Ualá, Klar |

## Pain Themes (for Messaging Drafter)

1. **Multi-country contractor payments** — Companies scaling across AR/BR/CO/MX have FX friction
2. **Compliance with new Brazil regulations** — Feb 2 deadline creates urgency
3. **Stablecoin integration** — Companies launching stablecoin products need compliant rails
4. **Payroll product launches** — Companies adding payroll features need infrastructure partner
5. **Cross-border vendor payments** — Scaling fintechs have B2B payment friction

---

## Handoff to Messaging Drafter (Agent 4)

- **Total targets for messaging:** 12 (10 Bitwage, 2 TeamPay)
- **Buyer personas:** CEO/Founder (5), CFO (2), VP Finance (1), TBD (4)
- **Pain themes:** Multi-country contractor payments, Brazil regs compliance, stablecoin rails, payroll product launches

### Recommended Messaging Approach

**For Bitwage targets:**
- Lead with specific trigger (funding, expansion, product launch)
- Reference Brazil Feb 2 regs if Brazilian company
- Position Bitwage as infrastructure partner, not competitor

**For TeamPay targets:**
- Lead with BTC treasury as wedge
- Position corporate finance tools for BTC-native ops
- Reference event/conference if applicable
