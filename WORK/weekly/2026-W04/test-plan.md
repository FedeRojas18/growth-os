### Target 1: Pomelo

**Buyer:** Gastón Irigoyen, CEO & Co-founder
**Trigger:** $55M Series C; launching stablecoin-backed global credit card + cross-border payment systems
**Pain:** Scaling multi-country card issuing (AR, BR, CL, CO, MX, PE); cross-border vendor payments for 150+ B2B clients

#### Email Variant A — Question-First

**Subject:** Who's handling your vendor payments in Paraguay?

Hi Gastón,

Stablecoin-backed credit card across six markets is ambitious — I'm curious how you're handling the vendor payment side. Six currencies, six banking relationships, or something more unified?

We run cross-border payments for a few multi-country fintechs at your stage. One dropped SWIFT entirely and cut their vendor payment cycle from 5 days to same-day.

Free Thursday afternoon? I can walk through what they did.

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First

**Subject:** 6 countries, 1 vendor payment platform

Hi Gastón,

You're issuing cards across AR, BR, CL, CO, MX, PE. We handle vendor payments across all of them from one dashboard — no more juggling six banking relationships.

A multi-country fintech your size saved $60K/year just by consolidating their vendor payment stack.

Can I send a one-pager on how it works?

Best,
[Name]

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi Gastón,

Stablecoin card across six LATAM markets — that's a lot of vendor payment complexity. We handle cross-border payments for fintechs doing exactly this. Want me to send over how one of them set it up?

[Name]

---

#### Notes for Sender
- Gastón is a serial founder, informal tone appropriate
- Pomelo works with major players (BBVA, Binance, Western Union) — they have sophisticated needs
- Stablecoin card launch creates natural alignment with Bitwage positioning
- Reference specific markets (Paraguay is interesting — less common)

---

### Target 2: Plata

**Buyer:** Neri Tollardo, CEO & Co-founder
**Trigger:** $250M Series B at $3.1B valuation; planning payroll solutions + international transfers; Colombia expansion
**Pain:** Growing from 100 to 3,000 employees; expanding to Colombia; launching payroll products = direct pain

#### Email Variant A — Observation-First

**Subject:** Plata building payroll while scaling payroll

Hi Neri,

You're launching payroll products for customers while simultaneously scaling from 100 to 3,000 employees across MX and CO. That's eating your own cooking in real-time.

Curious if you're building the cross-border payment rails in-house or looking for infrastructure partners. We power the LATAM contractor payments for a few fintechs at your stage — both for internal ops and as white-label infrastructure.

Worth a 20-minute call Tuesday to compare notes?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First

**Subject:** Infrastructure for your payroll product

Hi Neri,

You're building payroll solutions. We have the LATAM cross-border rails. Might make sense to talk.

We already handle contractor payments for 3 of the top 10 LATAM neobanks — could be relevant both for Plata's internal 3,000-person payroll and as infrastructure for what you're building.

Can I send a technical one-pager?

Best,
[Name]

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi Neri,

Building payroll products while scaling to 3,000 employees across two countries — that's a unique position to be in. We power LATAM contractor payments for fintechs. Interested in how we might fit into what you're building?

[Name]

---

#### Notes for Sender
- Plata is Mexico's highest-valued fintech ($3.1B) — they have options and resources
- Dual angle: internal contractor payments AND infrastructure for their payroll product
- Neri is founder/CEO, be direct and respect his time
- Colombia expansion is the immediate pain point

---

### Target 3: UY3

**Buyer:** Tabaré Acosta, CEO
**Trigger:** R$50M raised mid-2025; negotiating new round for early 2026; Brazil regs Feb 2
**Pain:** Credit infrastructure expanding; processing R$15B annually; needs compliant cross-border for vendors

#### Email Variant A — Direct-First (Urgency)

**Subject:** Feb 2 is 4 days away

Hi Tabaré,

Brazil's stablecoin regs hit Feb 2. At R$15B in annual volume, your cross-border vendor payments need to be compliant by then.

We've spent the last 6 months helping Brazilian fintechs get their payment rails in order for exactly this deadline. Happy to share what's working.

Free for 20 minutes before Friday?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Question-First

**Subject:** How's UY3 handling the Feb 2 compliance shift?

Hi Tabaré,

Curious how you're thinking about vendor payments post-Feb 2. At R$15B in credit volume, even small changes to cross-border compliance create real operational overhead.

We've been working with Brazilian fintechs on exactly this — most are consolidating vendor payments into compliant rails rather than retrofitting their existing setup.

Worth comparing notes this week?

Best,
[Name]

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi Tabaré,

Feb 2 regs are days away — how's UY3 handling the cross-border compliance piece? We've been helping Brazilian fintechs navigate this. Happy to share what we're seeing if useful.

[Name]

---

#### Notes for Sender
- **Time-sensitive:** Feb 2 deadline is real urgency — lead with it
- UY3 is negotiating new funding round — in growth mode
- Tabaré is CEO, be direct about the deadline
- R$15B volume means they're sophisticated — don't oversimplify

### Target 4: Klar

**Buyer:** Juan Sarmiento, VP of Finance
**Trigger:** $190M Series C at $800M valuation; acquired Bineo Sept 2025; nearing $300M revenue
**Pain:** Mexico's largest digital bank scaling rapidly; multi-country ops with Colombia; contractor payment friction

#### Email Variant A — Observation-First

**Subject:** Bineo integration + Colombia payments

Hi Juan,

Integrating Bineo while scaling Colombia ops — that's two finance projects competing for the same bandwidth. Curious how you're handling the contractor payment side across both countries.

We work with finance teams at fintechs your size managing exactly this. One VP Finance told me consolidating their MX/CO vendor payments freed up 10 hours/month of reconciliation work.

Worth a call to see if we can help simplify the stack?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First

**Subject:** MX + CO contractor payments

Hi Juan,

You're at $300M revenue with ops in two countries. Contractor payments shouldn't require two banking relationships and manual FX reconciliation.

We handle this for several fintechs at Klar's scale — one platform, both countries, money lands same-day.

Can I send a breakdown of how it works?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi Juan,

Post-acquisition integration plus Colombia expansion — that's a lot on one finance team's plate. We help VPs Finance at fintechs your size consolidate LATAM contractor payments. Worth a quick call?

[Name]

---

#### Notes for Sender
- Juan is VP Finance — focus on operational efficiency and time savings
- Post-acquisition integration = competing priorities, position as simplification
- Klar is at $300M revenue — they have budget, but also have options
- Colombia ops are the specific cross-border pain point

---

### Target 5: Ualá

**Buyer:** Pierpaolo Barbieri, Founder & CEO
**Trigger:** $366M Series E at $2.75B valuation; Mexico expansion; TelevisaUnivision investment
**Pain:** 9M users across AR/MX/CO; 1,500 employees in 3 countries; significant cross-border contractor base

#### Email Variant A — Question-First

**Subject:** How does Ualá handle AR/MX/CO payroll?

Hi Pierpaolo,

1,500 people across three countries with three currencies — genuinely curious how you're handling the contractor payment side. Running everything through Argentina, or separate banking relationships in each market?

We work with a few multi-country fintechs at your scale who've consolidated this. Happy to share what they did if it's useful.

Free for 15 minutes next week?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First

**Subject:** Three countries, one payment platform

Hi Pierpaolo,

AR, MX, CO — three currencies, three banking systems. At 1,500 employees, that's real money in FX spreads and operational overhead.

We handle this for multi-country fintechs. One dashboard, all three markets, contractors get paid same-day.

Worth a call to compare setups?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi Pierpaolo,

1,500 employees across AR, MX, CO is a unique payroll challenge. Curious how you're handling it — we work with fintechs at your scale on exactly this. Worth comparing notes?

[Name]

---

#### Notes for Sender
- Pierpaolo is a high-profile founder (author, historian) — thoughtful outreach may stand out
- Ualá at $2.75B likely has existing solutions — position as comparison, not pitch
- TelevisaUnivision investment is interesting context but not the hook
- Three-country ops is the clear pain point

---

### Target 6: Kapital

**Buyer:** Fernando Sandoval, CFO
**Trigger:** $100M Series C at $1.3B valuation; Latin America's first AI unicorn
**Pain:** SMB banking platform in MX/CO/US; scaling 300K customers; multi-country vendor payments

#### Email Variant A — Observation-First

**Subject:** MX/CO/US vendor payments at Kapital's scale

Hi Fernando,

300K SMB customers across three countries means your vendor ecosystem scales with you — and cross-border payments in MX, CO, and US each have their own quirks.

Curious how you're handling it. We work with a few fintech CFOs at your scale who've consolidated this into one platform. One told me it cut their reconciliation time in half.

Worth comparing setups?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First

**Subject:** Cross-border payments for a $1.3B fintech

Hi Fernando,

You're CFO of LATAM's first AI unicorn with ops in three countries. You don't need a generic pitch — you need to know if we can do something your current setup can't.

We handle MX/CO/US vendor payments on one platform. Money lands same-day. Happy to show you the dashboard and let you judge.

20 minutes Thursday?

Best,
[Name]

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi Fernando,

MX, CO, and US vendor payments at 300K-customer scale — curious how Kapital handles that. We work with fintech CFOs on exactly this. Worth a quick call to compare?

[Name]

---

#### Notes for Sender
- Fernando is CFO — respect his time, be direct, focus on outcomes
- "LATAM's first AI unicorn" is their headline — acknowledge but don't dwell
- US ops add complexity beyond typical LATAM fintechs — differentiated angle
- 300K SMB customers = significant vendor ecosystem

### Target 7: Magie

**Buyer:** Luiz Ramalho, CEO & Co-founder
**Trigger:** $28M raised; AI financial assistant scaling; Lux Capital led seed
**Pain:** Scaling WhatsApp-based fintech; hiring tech talent in Brazil; need contractor payment rails

#### Email Variant A — Question-First

**Subject:** How's Magie handling contractor payments?

Hi Luiz,

Scaling a WhatsApp-based AI assistant means hiring engineers fast. Curious how you're set up for contractor payments — building that in-house or using something off the shelf?

Asking because Feb 2 regs add compliance requirements that catch some Brazilian fintechs off guard. We've been helping startups at your stage get ahead of it.

Worth a quick call this week?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First

**Subject:** Feb 2 regs + contractor payments

Hi Luiz,

You're scaling engineering. Brazil's stablecoin regs hit Feb 2. Your contractor payment setup needs to be compliant.

We handle this for Brazilian fintechs — compliant rails, same-day payouts. Can set up in days, not weeks.

Want me to send a quick overview?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi Luiz,

WhatsApp-based AI assistant is a cool approach. As you scale the team, how are you handling contractor payments? Feb 2 regs add some wrinkles. We help Brazilian fintechs with exactly this.

[Name]

---

#### Notes for Sender
- Magie is smaller (30 employees) — may not have immediate large-scale needs
- Lux Capital backing = quality investors, likely sophisticated ops expectations
- WhatsApp-based approach is genuinely interesting — acknowledge it
- Feb 2 regs create urgency even for smaller companies

---

### Target 8: Monet

**Buyer:** [Research needed], CEO/Founder
**Trigger:** Alliance with Grupo Bancolombia; expanding to Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico
**Pain:** Payroll-backed lending expanding to 4 Central American markets; multi-country ops creates FX friction

#### Email Variant A — Observation-First

**Subject:** Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico — that's 4 banking relationships

Hi [Name],

The Bancolombia alliance gives you distribution, but expanding payroll lending to four Central American markets means setting up vendor payments in each. Four countries, four currencies, four sets of banking quirks.

Curious how you're approaching it. We help fintechs doing multi-country expansion consolidate this — one platform instead of four vendor relationships.

Worth a call to compare approaches?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Question-First

**Subject:** How's Monet handling Central American vendor payments?

Hi [Name],

Payroll-backed lending across PA, SV, GT, MX — each market has its own payment infrastructure headaches. Are you building local banking relationships in each, or looking for something unified?

We work with fintechs doing exactly this expansion. Happy to share what's worked for others.

Best,
[Name]

#### LinkedIn Message

---

### Target 9: iCred

**Buyer:** [Research needed], CFO/Finance Director
**Trigger:** Raised R$1.15B ($208M) in FIDCs for payroll-deducted loan expansion
**Pain:** Major payroll fintech; large contractor network for distribution; cross-border compliance needs

#### Email Variant A — Direct-First (Urgency)

**Subject:** Feb 2 regs + your contractor network

Hi [Name],

R$1.15B in FIDCs means iCred's contractor distribution network is about to scale significantly. Feb 2 regs add compliance requirements to how you pay that network.

We've been helping Brazilian fintechs get their contractor payment rails compliant before the deadline. Worth a call this week to see if it applies to your setup?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Question-First

**Subject:** How does iCred pay its distribution network?

Hi [Name],

Payroll-deducted loans at your scale require a serious contractor distribution network. Curious how you're handling payments to that network — especially with Feb 2 compliance changes coming.

We work with Brazilian fintechs on exactly this. Happy to share what we're seeing.

Best,

### Target 10: DDC Enterprise

**Pain:** Bitcoin-native company needing corporate finance tools; international ops with LATAM exposure

#### Email Variant A — Question-First

**Subject:** How does DDC handle corporate expenses on a BTC treasury?

Hi [Name],

Third BTC purchase of 2026, treasury at 1,683 BTC — you're clearly thinking long-term in Bitcoin terms. Curious how you handle the day-to-day corporate spending side. Converting to fiat for every expense, or something else?

We built TeamPay specifically for companies like yours — corporate card that spends BTC directly, no conversion required for every purchase.

Worth a call to see if it fits?

Best,
[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First

**Subject:** 1,683 BTC treasury, fiat expense problem

Hi [Name],

You're accumulating BTC. You're also running a company with expenses. Most finance tools force you to convert for every purchase — that's not how BTC-native companies should operate.

#### LinkedIn Message

Hi [Name],

#### Notes for Sender
- **RESEARCH NEEDED:** CFO name not identified — Hong Kong HQ complicates research
- TeamPay fit, not Bitwage
- Active accumulation (3 purchases in 2026) = strong Bitcoin commitment — speak their language
- LATAM exposure creates potential Bitwage cross-sell later

**Trigger:** CEO presenting at Digital Asset Treasury Virtual Conference Jan 27
**Pain:** BTC-native company actively engaging treasury community; needs corporate finance tools

**Pain:** Aggressive BTC accumulation strategy; needs treasury management tools

#### Email Variant A — Question-First

**Subject:** How do you handle expenses on a 5,843 BTC treasury?

Hi [Name],

17 BTC/day accumulation is aggressive — one of the higher rates I've seen. Curious how you're handling the corporate expense side. Converting to fiat as needed, or something more systematic?

We built TeamPay for treasuries like yours — corporate card that spends BTC directly, so you're not constantly converting for every expense.

Worth a call to compare setups?

[Name]

---

#### Email Variant B — Direct-First
