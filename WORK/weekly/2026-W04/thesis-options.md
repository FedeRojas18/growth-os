## Option 1: LATAM Fintechs with Recent Funding + Cross-Border Needs ⭐ Recommended

**Thesis Statement:** Target LATAM-focused fintechs that raised Series A+ in the past 90 days, as they're scaling operations and likely adding cross-border contractor payments or stablecoin infrastructure.

**Why Now:**
- Pomelo raised $55M Series C this week for stablecoin-backed global credit card
- UY3 raised $37.2M for credit infrastructure in Brazil
- LATAM fintech investment revival forecast for 2026 with fintech as key focus area
- Brazil regulations (Feb 2) create urgency for compliant payment partners

**Segment:** LATAM-expanding fintechs with cross-border payroll needs

**Primary BU:** Bitwage

**Expected Targets:** 10-15 companies
- Pomelo (Argentina) — $55M Series C, 150+ clients, stablecoin credit card launch
- UY3 (Brazil) — $37.2M raised, credit infrastructure
- Additional targets from Crunchbase/LAVCA funding announcements

**Best Triggers:** Funding round, Hiring, Expansion, Stablecoin adoption

**Buyer Persona:** CFO, VP Finance, Head of People/Operations

**Expected ROI:**
- 3-4 replies (based on 8-10% reply rate for funded companies)
- 1-2 meetings
- Direct pipeline for Bitwage

**Risk/Consideration:**
- Funded fintechs may have in-house payment solutions
- Need to validate actual cross-border payroll pain (not all fintechs have LATAM contractors)

**Score Breakdown:**
| Factor | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Signal density | **High** | 4+ signals this week (Pomelo, UY3, general LATAM funding activity) |
| Trigger strength | **High** | Funding round = clear "why now"; capital to solve payment friction |
| BU priority | **High** | Bitwage core segment |
| Conversion history | **Med** | Similar thesis tested; ~8% reply rate historically |
| Research effort | **High** | Public funding data available via Crunchbase, LAVCA |

**Total Score: 88/100**

## Option 2: Bitcoin-Native Companies at LABITCONF 2026

**Thesis Statement:** Target Bitcoin-native companies whose executives are speaking, sponsoring, or confirmed attending LABITCONF 2026 (May 8, CDMX), offering TeamPay BTC card as ecosystem wedge with warm intro path.

**Why Now:**
- LABITCONF ₿2B announced for May 8, 2026 with business focus
- 14-week pre-event window for outreach
- Event concentrates Bitcoin-native CFOs and founders in single venue
- Dual-channel opportunity: TeamPay logos + Bitwage pipeline

**Segment:** LATAM fintech event attendees/speakers (pre-event targeting) + Bitcoin-native companies needing corporate finance tools

**Primary BU:** TeamPay (with Bitwage secondary)

**Expected Targets:** 8-12 companies
- Speakers/sponsors from LABITCONF roster (as published)
- Bitcoin Treasury Corporation (Canadian BTC-native, presenting at conferences)
- Bitcoin-native LATAM operators

**Best Triggers:** Event presence, Community activity, Crypto/BTC treasury

**Buyer Persona:** CFO, Founder, BD Lead

**Expected ROI:**
- 2-3 warm intros via event context
- 1 event meeting scheduled
- 2-3 TeamPay logo conversations

**Risk/Consideration:**
- Full speaker list may not be published yet
- 14 weeks is early; may get better signal density closer to event
- Dependent on event timing; if delayed, thesis weakens

**Score Breakdown:**
| Factor | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Signal density | **Med** | 3 signals this week; more expected as speaker list published |
| Trigger strength | **High** | Event presence = forcing function for meetings |
| BU priority | **High** | TeamPay ecosystem wedge is strategic priority |
| Conversion history | **N/A** | New thesis; no prior data |
| Research effort | **Med** | Speaker lists public once announced; some companies not yet visible |

**Total Score: 78/100**

## Option 3: Bitcoin Treasury Companies with Active BTC Accumulation

**Thesis Statement:** Target companies with active Bitcoin treasury strategies (accumulating BTC in 2026) who need corporate finance tools for BTC-native operations.

**Why Now:**
- DDC Enterprise added 100 BTC this week (3rd purchase of 2026), total 1,683 BTC
- American Bitcoin at 5,843 BTC, averaging 17 BTC/day
- Riot Platforms CFO transition March 1 creates leadership change window
- Bitcoin Treasury Corporation presenting at Digital Asset Treasury Conference
- MSCI decision NOT to exclude BTC treasury companies validates strategy

**Segment:** Bitcoin-native companies needing corporate finance tools

**Primary BU:** TeamPay

**Expected Targets:** 6-8 companies
- DDC Enterprise (1,683 BTC treasury)
- American Bitcoin (5,843 BTC treasury)
- Riot Platforms (CFO transition)
- Bitcoin Treasury Corporation (Canadian, active in conferences)
- Hyperscale Data ($48.5M BTC treasury)

**Best Triggers:** Crypto/BTC treasury, Event presence, Exec moves

**Buyer Persona:** CFO, Treasurer, Founder

**Expected ROI:**
- 2 replies from BTC-native companies
- 1 meeting or demo
- TeamPay logo acquisition potential

**Risk/Consideration:**
- Smaller target pool (6-8 vs. 10-15)
- Large treasury companies (Riot, etc.) may have enterprise solutions
- Longer sales cycle for TeamPay platform adoption

**Score Breakdown:**
| Factor | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Signal density | **Med** | 5 signals this week but concentrated in few companies |
| Trigger strength | **Med** | BTC accumulation is ongoing; less urgent than funding or event |
| BU priority | **High** | TeamPay core audience |
| Conversion history | **N/A** | New thesis for 2026 |
| Research effort | **High** | BTC treasury companies are public; easy to research |

**Total Score: 72/100**

## Segments Excluded (Failed Guardrails)

| Segment | Reason Excluded |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Paraguay Mining Operations** | Signal density weak: only 2 companies (HIVE expanding, Bitfarms exiting). Market consolidating, not expanding. Fails ≥3 company threshold. |
| **US Remittance Tax Arbitrage** | Buyer clarity weak: "remittance companies" is broad; need to identify specific decision-makers. Park for Thursday deep research to build target list. |
| **NGOs / Circular Economy** | Signal density: Zero signals this week. No actionable companies identified. |
| **Stablecoin Payment Providers** | Buyer clarity weak: Partnership vs. customer path unclear. Circle is partner lead, not target. Needs more research. |

---

## Recommendation

**Select Option 1: LATAM Fintechs with Recent Funding + Cross-Border Needs**

### Why Option 1:

1. **Highest signal density (4+ signals)** — Multiple funded companies identified this week with clear trigger
2. **Proven segment** — Similar thesis tested previously with ~8% reply rate; we know the buyer persona works
3. **Immediate Bitwage pipeline** — Funded fintechs scaling operations have urgent cross-border payment pain
4. **Time-sensitive** — Brazil regs (Feb 2) create additional urgency for compliant partners
5. **Research efficiency** — Funding data is public; can build target list quickly

### Why Not Option 2 (LABITCONF):
- Strong thesis, but 14 weeks out is early
- Speaker list not fully published yet
- **Recommendation:** Queue for Week 6-8 when event details solidify

### Why Not Option 3 (BTC Treasury):
- Smaller target pool (6-8 vs. 10-15)
- Companies like Riot already have enterprise solutions
- **Recommendation:** Add DDC Enterprise and Bitcoin Treasury Corporation to Option 1 list as secondary targets

## Blended Approach (If Operator Prefers)

If TeamPay logos are a higher priority this week, consider:

**Primary:** Option 1 (8-10 Bitwage targets)
**Secondary:** Add 3-4 BTC treasury targets from Option 3 (DDC, American Bitcoin, Bitcoin Treasury Corp)

This delivers:
- 12-14 total targets
- Dual-channel value (Bitwage pipeline + TeamPay logos)
- Mix of triggered companies (funding + BTC treasury)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Human selects thesis** — Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, or Blended
2. **Trigger Target List Builder (Agent 3)** — Begins research on selected thesis
3. **Tuesday:** Finalize target list, run Messaging Drafter, assemble weekly test plan
