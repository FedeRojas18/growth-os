## Key Ecosystem Signals

1. **Brazil stablecoin regulations effective Feb 2:** Creates compliance urgency for Brazilian fintechs. UY3 messaging positioned around this deadline. Multiple Brazilian targets (UY3, Magie, iCred) have relevant pain.

2. **Hawksburn Capital acquiring Bitfarms Paraguay facility for $30M:** Singapore fund entering LATAM mining market. New entrant = greenfield opportunity for vendor payment infrastructure. Partner one-pager completed.

3. **LABITCONF ₿2B announced for May 8 in Mexico City:** Business-focused Bitcoin event. Pre-event targeting window of ~14 weeks. Strong thesis candidate for next week.

1. LABITCONF ₿2B Pre-Event Targeting (speakers/sponsors for TeamPay)
2. Brazil Stablecoin Regulation Catalyst (Feb 2 deadline urgency for Bitwage)
3. Continue LATAM Fintechs thesis (follow-up on this week's targets)

**Focus:**
- Begin outreach on Tier 1 targets (Pomelo, Plata, UY3)
- Complete buyer research for 4 targets missing contact names
- Advance partner research on Hawksburn Capital and Circle
- Stablecoin Brazil event (Feb 10-11) — confirm Circle presence for potential meeting

- **Intro request:** Any connections to Circle LATAM team or Hawksburn Capital leadership?
- **Decision needed:** Which thesis to prioritize next week — LABITCONF pre-event (TeamPay focus) vs. Brazil regs catalyst (Bitwage focus)?
