## Template Usage Notes

### Wins Section Guidelines
- Focus on OUTCOMES, not activities
- Good: "Booked meeting with PayFlow VP Finance"
- Bad: "Researched 15 companies this week"
- Include the specific name/company when possible

### Pipeline Snapshot Guidelines
- Always show change vs. last week
- Highlight movements that matter (New → Meeting = great; stuck in Contacted for 2 weeks = concern)
- If pipeline movement = 0, this is a red flag — address in Blockers section

### Signals Section Guidelines
- Only include signals with strategic implications
- Must include "what it means for us" — not just the news
- Limit to 2-3 signals max (don't overwhelm)

### Blockers Section Guidelines
- Be specific: "Need intro to X" not "Need more intros"
- If asking for something, make it easy to say yes
- If no blockers, say "None this week" — don't leave blank

### Formatting Guidelines
- Keep total email under 400 words
- Use consistent formatting (this template)
- Make it scannable — busy execs skim
- Bold key numbers and company names
