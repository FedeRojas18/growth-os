## What Counts as an Experiment

An experiment is a deliberate test of a hypothesis about what will drive pipeline or partnerships. Examples:

- Testing a new segment/thesis
- Testing a new trigger type
- Testing a new messaging approach
- Testing a new channel (email vs. LinkedIn vs. event)
- Testing a new partner type
- Testing a new source for signals

Experiments have:
1. A hypothesis (what we think will happen)
2. A test design (how we'll test it)
3. Success criteria (what "working" looks like)
4. A timeframe (when we'll evaluate)
5. Results (what actually happened)

## Experiment Template

Copy this template when starting a new experiment:

```markdown
## Experiment [ID]: [Name]

**Status:** [Running / Completed / Paused]

### Hypothesis
[What we believe will happen. Be specific and falsifiable.]

### Test Design
[How we're testing this. What specifically are we doing?]

### Success Criteria
[What does "working" look like? Include specific numbers if possible.]
- Primary metric: [e.g., "Reply rate >10%"]
- Secondary metric: [e.g., "At least 1 meeting booked"]

### Timeframe
- Start: [Date]
- End: [Date]
- Evaluation: [When we'll review results]

### Resources Required
[What's needed to run this experiment]
- Time: [Hours/week]
- Budget: [If any]
- Other: [Tools, access, etc.]

### Results
[Fill in when experiment concludes]

**Primary metric result:** [Actual vs. target]
**Secondary metric result:** [Actual vs. target]
**Outcome:** [Success / Partial Success / Failure]

### Learnings
[What did we learn? What will we do differently?]

### Next Steps
[What happens based on these results?]
- [ ] [Action item]

## Experiment Ideas Backlog

Ideas for future experiments to run when capacity allows:

| Idea | Hypothesis | Priority | Blocked By |
|------|------------|----------|------------|
| [Idea] | [What we'd test] | [High/Med/Low] | [Any dependencies] |

### Suggested Experiments (from SOW)

The 90-day goals include "2-3 growth experiments." Potential experiments:

1. **Segment test:** Compare reply rates between 2 different segments in the same week
2. **Trigger test:** Compare hiring triggers vs. funding triggers for same segment
3. **Channel test:** Compare email-first vs. LinkedIn-first for same targets
4. **Messaging test:** Compare pain-led vs. trigger-led messaging variants
5. **Event test:** Measure pre-event outreach conversion vs. at-event networking
6. **Partner test:** Compare referral volume from different partner types

## Experiment Guardrails

Before running an experiment:
- [ ] Hypothesis is specific and falsifiable
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Timeframe is realistic (usually 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Experiment doesn't disrupt core weekly deliverables
- [ ] Resources are available

During experiment:
- [ ] Track data consistently
- [ ] Don't change variables mid-experiment
- [ ] Document unexpected observations

After experiment:
- [ ] Calculate results vs. success criteria
- [ ] Document learnings
- [ ] Apply learnings to system (update Trigger Library, Segment Menu, etc.)
