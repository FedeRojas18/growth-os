## Purpose of This Document

This is the "brain" of the Growth OS — a place to capture:
1. Ecosystem insights that inform targeting
2. Segments that passed scope guardrails but aren't active this week
3. Signals that are "interesting but no conversion path visible"
4. Learnings from outreach experiments
5. Competitive intelligence
6. Market trends and regulatory developments

**Key distinction:** Active targets go in `target-pipeline.md`. Active theses go in weekly test plans. This document is for CONTEXT and WATCH items.
