## Channel-Level Weekly Scorecard

The 5 numbers that matter, reported every Friday:

| # | Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|---|--------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Test plan shipped | Yes every Tuesday | Was `/weekly-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly-test-plan.md` created and handed off? |
| 2 | Targets added to pipeline | 10-15/week | Count of new entries in `target-pipeline.md` with state = New |
| 3 | Pipeline state changes | ≥3/week | Count of state transitions in `target-pipeline.md` (New→Contacted, Contacted→Replied, etc.) |
| 4 | Partner conversations advanced | 1-2/week | Count of partner status changes in `partnership-pipeline.md` OR new partner one-pagers |
| 5 | Exec update shipped | Yes every Friday | Was exec update email sent to leadership? |

### Scoring

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 5/5 | Great week | Continue current approach |
| 4/5 | Acceptable | Note which metric missed, address if pattern |
| 3/5 | Below target | Identify root cause, adjust next week |
| 2/5 or below | Red flag | Escalate in exec update, request support |

## BU-Level ROI Definitions

### Bitwage

| What Counts as ROI | Weekly Leading Indicator | How to Track |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Qualified lead → sales conversation → pipeline | Targets contacted | `target-pipeline.md` state = Contacted |
| | Replies received | `target-pipeline.md` state = Replied |
| | Meetings booked | `target-pipeline.md` state = Meeting |
| Revenue attribution from channel | Deals closed (quarterly) | HubSpot closed-won tagged "Ecosystem Channel" |

**Success criteria:** A "good" Bitwage outcome is a meeting booked with a qualified prospect who has active cross-border/contractor payment pain.

### TeamPay

| What Counts as ROI | Weekly Leading Indicator | How to Track |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Bitcoin-native logo acquired | BTC card interest signals | `target-pipeline.md` entries tagged TeamPay |
| Ecosystem credibility signal | Event connections made | Notes in partnership-pipeline or target-pipeline |
| | Logo pipeline growth | Count of BTC-native companies in pipeline |

**Success criteria:** A "good" TeamPay outcome is a Bitcoin-native company expressing interest in the BTC card, or a visible ecosystem presence (speaking, sponsoring, featuring).

### Mining

| What Counts as ROI | Weekly Leading Indicator | How to Track |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Strategic relationship advanced | Partner conversations | `partnership-pipeline.md` status changes |
| Infrastructure partner intro | Intro requests made/completed | Notes in partnership-pipeline |
| | Relationship depth (meeting → ongoing) | Partner status in pipeline |

**Success criteria:** A "good" Mining outcome is a strategic relationship advanced (meeting held, intro made) with a mining operation or infrastructure provider.

### Foundation

| What Counts as ROI | Weekly Leading Indicator | How to Track |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Ecosystem presence | Event attendance confirmed | Calendar / event tracking |
| Community engagement | Community mentions | Social monitoring (manual) |

**Success criteria:** Foundation work should consume ≤1-2 hrs/week. ROI is visibility and credibility, not leads.

## ROI Enforcement Rules

### Rule 1: Pipeline Movement > Pipeline Size

> It's better to have 20 targets with 5 moving forward than 50 targets stuck in "New."

- Track state CHANGES, not just state counts
- If pipeline movement = 0 for 2 consecutive weeks → stop adding new targets, focus on advancing existing ones
- Leading indicator: ≥3 state changes per week

### Rule 2: No Artifact = No Work

> If the week didn't produce a test plan, it didn't happen.

- Test plan must ship every Tuesday (even if abbreviated)
- Exec update must ship every Friday (even if abbreviated)
- If artifact isn't shipped → document why in Friday retro

### Rule 3: Exec Update is the Funding Mechanism

> Leadership visibility justifies the 20-hour/week investment.

- Exec update must be sent every Friday
- Exec update must include scorecard (5 metrics)
- Missing exec update = immediate escalation

### Rule 4: Reply Rate is the Quality Signal

> Outreach quality matters more than outreach volume.

- Track reply rate by thesis/segment: Replies ÷ Contacted
- Target: ≥10% reply rate
- If reply rate <5% for 2 weeks on a segment → retire or refine the segment
- If reply rate >15% → double down on the thesis

### Rule 5: Referrals are the Partnership ROI

> 10 organic referrals by day 90 is the partnership success metric.

- Track referrals from each partner
- Referral = lead that came through a partner intro (not cold outreach reply)
- Partner with 0 referrals after 60 days → evaluate relationship

## Weekly ROI Review Checklist (Friday)

Run this checklist every Friday before shipping exec update:

### Scorecard Check
- [ ] Test plan shipped this Tuesday? (Yes/No)
- [ ] How many targets added to pipeline this week? (Target: 10-15)
- [ ] How many pipeline state changes this week? (Target: ≥3)
- [ ] How many partner conversations advanced? (Target: 1-2)
- [ ] Is exec update ready to ship? (Yes — this is it)

### Pipeline Health Check
- [ ] Any targets stuck in same state >2 weeks? → Mark for follow-up or close
- [ ] Any targets with no "Next Action"? → Add specific next action
- [ ] Is pipeline movement positive? (More moving forward than stalling)

### Quality Check
- [ ] What was reply rate this week? (Replies ÷ Contacted)
- [ ] What thesis/segment produced the most replies?
- [ ] What thesis/segment produced zero replies? → Consider retiring

### Learning Check
- [ ] What trigger type worked best this week? → Update Trigger Library
- [ ] What segment showed highest conversion? → Update Segment Menu
- [ ] What messaging variant got responses? → Document in ecosystem-guide
